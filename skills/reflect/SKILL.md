name: reflect
description: Use when you want to reflect on and review your recent work — curate the candidates that /reflect-stage (the SessionEnd hook) staged in the queue and promote the approved ones into the live knowledge store. The only path from queue to live. Run whenever the queue holds unreviewed items.

# Reflect — review & promote the queue

## Overview

The curator half of the loop. Promote staged candidates into the live store — the **only** path
from `queue/` → `store/`. The human decides; you present clearly and execute choices precisely.

You promote staged reflection candidates into the live knowledge store. The human decides; you
present clearly and execute their choices precisely. This is the only path from queue → live.

All paths come from config. The one fixed anchor is `~/.claude/reflection/config.json`; read every
other path from it (resolve `~` to the current user's home).

## Inputs
- Config: `~/.claude/reflection/config.json` (for live target paths)
- Queue: `<queue_dir>/{memories,skills,docs}/`

## Procedure

### 1. Load and present the queue
Read every candidate in the three queue subdirs. For each, show a compact card:
- type, name/slug, the `description`, and for memories the `metadata.type` + `action`.
- For skills, also show the `PROPOSAL.md` evidence (why it recurs, what it replaces).
- For `update` memories, show a diff vs. the existing target file so the change is reviewable.

Group by type. If the queue is empty, say so and stop.

### 2. Ask for decisions
Present the list and ask the user to approve all, reject all, or pick per-item (accept / edit /
reject). Honor edits — apply the user's wording before promoting. Default to NOT promoting anything
the user didn't explicitly accept.

### 3. Promote approved items
- **Memories** → write into `config.targets.memories_dir`. Strip the reflection-only frontmatter
  keys (`source_sessions`, `proposed`, `action`, `target`) so the live file matches the standard
  memory contract (`name`, `description`, `metadata.type`). For `action: update`, edit the existing
  target file instead of creating a new one. Keep `description` keyword-rich — it is the retrieval
  key the hook scores prompts against.
- **Skills** → copy the candidate dir (SKILL.md only; drop `PROPOSAL.md`) into
  `config.targets.skills_dir/<name>/`. Verify frontmatter has valid `name` + `description`.
- **Docs** → move into `config.targets.docs_dir/` (strip the `> Proposed …` line or keep it as
  provenance, user's choice).

### 4. Regenerate the store index
After promotions, rewrite `config.targets.store_index` (`INDEX.md`) as a browsable list of every
live memory and doc — one line each: `- [name](relative/path.md) — description`. This index is a
human/browse aid ONLY; it is **not** loaded into sessions (retrieval is handled by the hook scoring
`description` fields), so it can grow without bounding session context. Group by `metadata.type`.

### 5. Clear processed items
Delete approved AND explicitly-rejected candidates from the queue. Leave deferred ("decide later")
items in place. Append a line to `~/.claude/reflection/logs/review.log` recording what was
promoted/rejected and when.

## Output
Summarize: what was promoted (with live paths), what was rejected, what remains queued. Confirm the
INDEX was regenerated. Remind the user the retrieval hook will surface these in future prompts
automatically — no per-session loading needed.

## Common mistakes
- **Promoting by default.** Only the items the user accepted in THIS review go live. Silence ≠ yes.
- **Leaving reflection-only frontmatter in live files.** Strip `source_sessions`, `proposed`,
  `action`, `target` — a live memory must match the standard contract exactly or it won't load.
- **Creating a near-duplicate instead of updating.** For `action: update`, edit the target file.
- **Forgetting the INDEX.** Regenerate `store_index` after promotions so the browse view stays true.
- **Not clearing the queue.** Approved AND rejected items must be removed, or the next review
  re-shows them.

## Guardrails
- Only promote items the user accepted in THIS review.
- Match each live format's contract exactly — a malformed skill or memory frontmatter breaks loading.
- Prefer editing an existing memory (action: update) over creating a near-duplicate.
- Dangling `[[links]]` to non-promoted memories are harmless; mention them but don't block on them.
